# BluemixExample


Welcome to the BluemixExample wiki!

Here is an example i have tried with Bluemix. It supports authentication, Speech to Text, Text to Speech and invoking RestAPI on both NodeJS and Java web services.

Once after setting up your bluemix account, Please add application route and application GUID from bluemix app to bluemixAppValues.plist file.

And add Speech to Text and Text to Speech credentials also to this plist file.
